# Recipe App

This app uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipe data. Users can search for specific recipes, filter by cuisine and view details about a particular recipe.

## General Notes:

-   You may need your own API key as this API is rate limited and won't work once the daily limit has been reached.
-   Number of results per query is set at a maximum of 20 to keep rate consumption down.

### Built with:

-   Vite
-   React
